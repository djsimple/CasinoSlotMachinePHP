Simulation of a casino slot machine using PHP & mySQL


HOW TO RUN APPLICATION

1. Navigate in browser to /create_tables.php this will create the database tables in phpMyadmin.

2. You do not need to insert data in the table to start playing the game because it will do this for you when you start.

3. Navigate to /index.php 

4. Click the button that says "start new game" and follow the prompts

5. Click the play button to play the slot machine after you have selected a bet amount radio button.

6. Add cash to game by adding cash to the field and click add cash

7. End the game by clicking cash out

8. See the top wins of all time by different players by clicking the button "View top wins of all time"

9. Click on the button that says XML report of average playing time to see restful api in action - all it is is reading an XML file that I created for reporting game statistics.
